<!-- Example file
So many things here: the point is to show that operations should take
place invisibly, behind the scenes. What shows up in the browser window
merely reflects what's going on in the code. If we are using a variable to
collect user input then we should pass the value to other variables to 
perform whatever operations we want to perform.  IN other words, there
is a variable for user input.  There are other variables for doing
other things.

time-consuming to do this all the time, so I never do it all the time,
but I'm doing it for the equal sign because my fancy-shmancy but oh-so-cheap
gaming keyboard returns different numbers for event.which depending on
which browser is running! Strange but true. This is probably a consequence
of the extra "game" keys on the keyboard, but who knows? I haven't tried
other keyboards or other computers yet; I will.  I just know that checking
event.code for "Equal" works in any browser.  The number and letter keys
don't show any variance.
