    <!-- create calculator-looking thing in the browser
    add event listeners to respond to mouse and keyboard
    write input numbers to a window in the calculator (CW)
    perform operation, output result to the CW
    keep going -->

<!-- What I know -->
<p>I will need event listeners<p>
<p>Keycodes</p>
<p>Buttons</p>
<p>Conver the string to a number through parse float</p>
<p>Mouse Buttons</p>
<p>Equal</p>
<p>Num1 + Num2</p>
<p>Summed Value</p>
<p>Summed Value becomes Num1</p>
<p>Begin the process once again</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Num 1 = 333</p>
<p>Check the Modifier</p>
<p>Num 2 = 555</p>
<p>Press Equal Sign</p>
<p>Num 1 (Check stored modifier) Num 2</p>
<p>Output is now set to the display</p>
<p>Output is now Num 1</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>
<p>If you are planning on using Keyboard and Mouse</p>
<p>Build proper functions so code does not have to be written twice</p>

<p>Possible Plans:</p>
<p>If statement checking for just modifiers</p>
<p>Store an array of modifiers</p>
<p>Push digits on either Num 1 or Num 2</p>
<p>Until any of the possible modifiers have been pressed</p>
<p>CHECK THEIR KEYCODE AND THE MOUSEBUTTON</p>
