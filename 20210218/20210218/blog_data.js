    title:'Hurricane Dorian',
    post:`Hurricane Dorian was the strongest hurricane to affect the Bahamas on
        record, causing catastrophic damage in the Abaco Islands and Grand
        Bahama in early September 2019. The cyclone's intensity as well as its
        slow forward motion near the Bahamas broke numerous records. The fifth
        tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first
        major hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Dorian
        originated from a westward-traveling tropical wave that departed from
        the western coast of Africa on August 19. The system organized into a
        tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on August 24.`};

    title: 'Dermotherium',
    post: `Dermotherium is a genus of fossil mammals closely related to the
        living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast
        Asia. Two species are recognized: D. major from the Late Eocene of
        Thailand, based on a single fragment of the lower jaw, and D. chimaera
        from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the
        lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single
        isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been
        tentatively assigned to D. chimaera. All sites where fossils of
        Dermotherium have been found were probably forested environments and
        the fossil species were probably forest dwellers like living colugos,
        but whether they had the gliding adaptations of the living species is
        unknown.`};

    post: `The Battle of Wesenberg, Rakvere or Rakovor was a battle fought on
        February 18, 1268, between the combined forces of Danish Duchy of
        Estonia, Bishopric of Dorpat, Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights,
        and local Estonian militia on one side and the forces of Novgorod and
        Pskov, led by Dmitry of Pereslavl, on the other. Medieval accounts of
        the battle vary with both sides claiming victory, however the Livonian
        victory being more plausible as Novgorodian-Pskovian forces retreated
        out of Danish Estonia, with Livonian Knights launching a retaliatory
        attack on Izborsk and Pskov soon afterward, in June 1269.`};
